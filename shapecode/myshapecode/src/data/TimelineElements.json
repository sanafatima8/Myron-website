The entire path set before me consisted of four obstacles:  getting accepted into the university, getting accepted into the First Year Engineering College (FYE acceptance rate: 47%) , getting accepted into the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and then graduate. Because I had one of the obstacles down I was confident and willing to take the risk. ",

I talked to my counselor and asked why but I was not really given a good explanation. I was discouraged. Nonetheless they accepted me into the First Year Engineering college within Purdue University. Two more obstacles left. While I was at Purdue, I participated in the Engineering Projects in Community Service Course EPICS part of a team that built a project called “A Fresh Start” that was recognize at UC Berkeley. I also helped on the University 3D printing lab website. I also participated in the Minority Engineering Program (MEP), Black Student Union (BSU), and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).

I was sad and disappointed for a while, as I wanted that degree very much, in my mind I blamed myself for everything, the failure hurt more than anything I had experienced up to this point, I stopped writing code, and even struggled with my mental health for some time because of the experience I had there, but I had to find another way.",

I then stumbled upon Udemy and completed a bootcamp in iOS app development from Angela Yu among other courses on Udemy and I interviewed and landed an internship as an iOS developer during my community college education. The internship was paying higher than any other job I had till then, it was with Whistle Mobile, I had an epiphany, this little $10 course had done more for my life in 3 months than a whole 5 years I spent in different colleges.

I worked there for around 9 months, this helped me save up as this time my  education was completely paid for by another scholarship.I graduated with honors as well as a focus in Mobile Development and Artificial Intelligence. After everything I reached my goal. Throughout it all I was thankful, for the journey, for believing I could accomplish it, for the hard work I put in, and for never giving up.
